   Academic Integrity Statement

   I, the person named in the @author comment above, have fully reviewed the
   course academic integrity policies.  I have adhered to those policies in
   solving the assignment.

   The policies do permit some limited collaboration among students currently
   enrolled in the course. If I did engage in such collaboration, here is the
   list of other students with whom I collaborated, and a brief summary of that
   collaboration:

   - none, signed Emma Farkash, Henry Li, Nathaniel Chin, Jackie Peng

   Here are any deviations from the policies that I want to document, with the
   understanding that being honest about my mistakes is more honorable than
   lying about my intellectual work:

   - none, signed Emma Farkash, Henry Li, Nathaniel Chin, Jackie Peng
